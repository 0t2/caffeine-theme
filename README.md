# Kelyvin Ghost Theme

---

## Introduction

**Kelyvin** is a fork of [Uno-Zen for Ghost by Kikobeats v2.5.7](https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen).

## Installation

Please ensure that `git` is installed on your machine.

Enter the theme folder (`content/themes`) of your Ghost installation and paste the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kelyvin/kelyvin-ghost-theme
```

**NOTE:** This theme needs jQuery to works fine, but jQuery library is not provided by the theme. Instead, you need to inject from the `Blog Footer` in the `Code injection` of your Ghost installation:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
```

It should look like this:
